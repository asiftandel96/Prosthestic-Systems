# **Prosthestic-Systems**


Problem Statement
Prosthetic Systems is a medical health provider with value added services towards its 
customer. Due to tough completion in the niche market, its struggling to sell its products and 
make profits. As they deal with only specialized products having very low volume, there is no 
way they can increase the sales to make up the revenue and the profit. The management is 
deciding to have a separate vertical that can finance the customers for the sales and services 
for these premium products. This will enable them to stay in the market, as well as they can 
expand their finance division if that rolls out well. As the company does not have a full banking 
experience or is not supervised by a national or international banking regulatory agency so 
they are going to tie up with a investment firm to start the company with some shared 
revenue model. Now the challenge for them is to determine how they are going to select the 
customers to reach out. The company wants to build a model that will help them identify the 
potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase 
the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.
